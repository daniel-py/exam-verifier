# exam_verifier_app

A flutter app to verify exam documents (passes) using QR codes

## Getting Started

This is my final year project for my B.Sc degree in Computer Science at Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta.

It simply scans a QR Code and returns the authentic exam pass associated with that QR Code. 

I had finished the entire thing on my local machine before I remembered to upload on Github.
